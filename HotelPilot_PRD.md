## 10. Core workflows

### 10.1 Flight aware pricing

**Objective**  
Use inbound flight and event signals to nudge rates on the correct dates with clear limits.

**Inputs**  
Scheduled and actual arrivals by hour for home and alternate airports, aircraft capacity class, holidays and events, pace, optional fare pressure proxy.

**Computation**  
`demand_lift_index = 0.7 * seat_capacity_delta + 0.3 * fare_pressure_proxy + event_weight`  
Confidence reflects data freshness and source agreement. Minimum sample size applies.

**Decision logic**  
- Index 0.2 to 0.4: propose ADR plus 5 to 8 percent.  
- Index 0.4 to 0.7: propose plus 9 to 15 percent.  
- Index above 0.7: propose up to cap, require approval on peak holidays.  
- If ops_disruption_risk is high: freeze tonightâ€™s hikes, shift to next day.  
- Suggestions only when confidence under 0.6.

**Action**  
Push fenced rate plans or restrictions via PMS or channel manager. Never overwrite base BAR. Log dates, seats vs baseline, holiday or event flags, confidence, caps applied.

**Ops Copilot card**  
Seats plus 18 percent Fri evening. Proposed ADR plus 8 percent Fri and plus 5 percent Sat. Confidence 0.78. Within caps. Parity OK.

---

### 10.2 Automated voice bookings and changes

**Intents**  
New booking, modify, cancel, late check in or checkout, amenity request, billing question, directions and parking.

**Flow**  
Greet and record consent, detect language, classify intent, offer 2 to 3 inventory options with price and terms, capture guest details, take deposit via pay link or DTMF inside PCI scope, write to PMS, send confirmation, update housekeeping tasks, open tickets if needed. Handoff to staff when rules or confidence require it.

**Guardrails**  
Rate caps and cushions respected. VIP or group routes to human. No card data in transcripts.

---

### 10.3 Guest messaging
